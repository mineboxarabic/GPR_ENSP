<h2>Difficulties </h2>
<hr>

<p>
1 - Creating the router was very hard because I needed to make links between the URI and the GET and POST methods and the array I created to make the link possible and easier to understand
</p>
<br>

<p>
2- Making the DB connection was hard because I had to use a new way to connect to the data base using a <span style="font-size:15px;color:green;">"Composer" </span> and library called <span style="font-size:15px;color:green;">"database" </span>, so learining about a new library and a new File manager and libraries in php was new but hard.
